                Quick Start
                The quickest way to get started with express is to utilize the executable express(1) to generate an application as shown
                below:
                
                Install the executable. The executable's major version will match Express's:
                
                $ npm install -g express-generator@4
                Create the app:
                
                $ express /tmp/foo && cd /tmp/foo
                Install dependencies:
                
                $ npm install
                Start the server:
                
                $ npm start
                View the website at: http://localhost:3000
                
                Philosophy
                The Express philosophy is to provide small, robust tooling for HTTP servers, making it a great solution for single page
                applications, websites, hybrids, or public HTTP APIs.
                
                Express does not force you to use any specific ORM or template engine. With support for over 14 template engines via
                Consolidate.js, you can quickly craft your perfect framework.
                
                Examples
                To view the examples, clone the Express repo and install the dependencies:
                
                $ git clone git://github.com/expressjs/express.git --depth 1
                $ cd express
                $ npm install
                Then run whichever example you want:
                
                $ node examples/content-negotiation
